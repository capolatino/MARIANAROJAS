# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER

## Problem Diagnosis
Vercel is not detecting new commits from GitHub. This file is created to force deployment.

## Current Status
- **Latest Local Commit**: c7e94d8 - fix: add webpack alias configuration to resolve UI component imports
- **GitHub Remote**: https://github.com/capolatino/MARIANAROJAS.git
- **Branch**: main
- **Issue**: Vercel still using commit 53d20a2 (very old)

## Changes Made
1. Moved autoprefixer to dependencies
2. Added webpack alias configuration
3. Fixed component imports
4. Updated vercel.json configuration

## Expected Behavior
Vercel should detect this commit and deploy with proper dependencies and component resolution.

---
**Created**: $(date)
**Purpose**: Force Vercel to recognize changes and deploy latest commit
